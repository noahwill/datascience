# Noah will DataScience! 

_This repository contains projects from the DataCamp 'Python for Data Science' course._

## Case Studies:

* [War at the Olympics!](https://github.com/noahwill/datascience/tree/master/OlympicMedals) –
Is there a better way to practice manipulating DataFrames in pandas than to learn about the true nature of the Cold War?
* [Cleaning Data](https://github.com/noahwill/datascience/tree/master/CleaningCaseStudy) – Check out my first case study that looked at life expectancy data to teach me about what it takes to clean a data set in Python!
