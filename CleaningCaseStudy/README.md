# Data Cleaning Case Study

This Case Study may be found at the end of the [Cleaning Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-python) course provided by Data Camp.

The course itself used Gapminder data that showed life expectancy by country from 1800-1899, however for the project I am featuring here, I am using the complete data set found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=phAwcNAVuyj2tPLxKvvnNPA&output=xlsx).
