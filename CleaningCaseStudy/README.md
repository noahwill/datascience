# Data Cleaning Case Study

This Case Study may be found at the end of the [Cleaning Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-python) course provided by Data Camp.

The course itself used Gapminder data that showed life expectancy by country from 1800-1899, however for the project I am featuring here, I am using the complete data set found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=phAwcNAVuyj2tPLxKvvnNPA&output=xlsx).

## Formatting Data

The file of data from Gapminder is downloadable as .xlxs, however for this project I wanted to practice manipulating .csv files. So, in the .xlxs file, I replaces all the blank spaces with NaN to signify missing data points. Then, I saved the sheet as a .csv file. 

That file, found in this repository as **g18002016.csv**, contains life expectancy data by country from 1800 to 2016.
